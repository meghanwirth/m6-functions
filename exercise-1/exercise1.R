# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
hometown <- 'corvallis'
# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`
my.name <- 'Meghan'
# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`
my.height <- 'five foot three inches'
# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
puppies <- '2'
# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is
puppy.price <- '400'
# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000

# Create a variable `max.puppies`, which is the nuber of puppies you can afford for $1K.

hometown <- Corvallis
'hometown' <- Corvallis
hometown <- 'Corvallis'

total.cost <- '800'
too.expensive <- 800 > 1000
max.puppies <- '2'
# Write a function to add two numbers together
AddNumbers <- function(a, b) {   
  # Function body: perform tasks in here   
  answer <- a + b
# Return statement: what you want the function to output   return (answer) }
a + B
AddNumbers <- function (a,b)
answer <- a + b
return (answer)
